📊 How It Works

The dataset is loaded from credit_data.csv.

The target column Approved is label encoded.

A Random Forest model is trained using user financial data.

Inputs from the GUI are passed to the model in real-time for prediction.

The result is shown in the GUI as "Approved" or "Not Approved".
